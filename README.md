Video Resizer is an extension that enables you to resize video files right in your browser.

To work with this web app, please first add your input video file via the file selector at the top. The input video can be from several formats such as .mp4, .webm, etc. To see the complete list of supported formats, please visit this Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg). Next, adjust your settings and then click on the - RESIZE - button to start the operation. Once the resizing is finished, the final video file will be downloaded to your machine. Within the settings section, there are four categories for resizing options. Click on the appropriate category and then fill in the required fields. By default, the first category is chosen.
